		<h2><a class="" name="the_game">WARNING</a></h2>
		<p>TESTNET RELEASE ONLY. DO NOT SEND REAL ETHER.</p>
		<p>This is the pre-alpha release of Etheroll, a Ðapp that provides a provably-fair Ethereum gambling and casino experience online. Currently, Etheroll will only run if you are running your own local testnet Ethereum blockchain.</p>
		<p>The current maximum bet during our pre-alpha release phase is 1 Ether. If you submit more than 1 Ether the smart-contract will not be invoked. Do not send more than 1 Ether.</p>
		<p>The initial bankroll for the pre-alpha release was 25 Ether.</p>
		<p>You may win or lose some Ether playing Etheroll. The chances of winning or losing on each round of die roll is 50/50 and the house edge is 2%. Winners are paid 1.98 to 1.</p>
		<h2><a class="green" name="the_game">Disclaimer</a></h2>
		<p>You must be 18 years or older to play Etheroll. By playing Etheroll you agree that you are over 18 years of age and that you are also playing Etheroll within a jurisdiction that does not consider interacting with and/or placing bets and/or profiting and/or losing from an Ethereum online casino to be illegal in any way shape or form.</p>
		<p>No refunds. No acceptances.</p>
		<h2><a class="green" name="the_game">How to play</a></h2>
		<p>Etheroll is the world's first Ethereum casino that allows you to gamble entirely within the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
		<p>To almost double your Ether (we pay 1.98 to 1), just guess correctly on the result of a 100 sided dice roll. The result of the dice roll is either a low roll range (1-49) or a high roll range (50-100).</p>
		<p>If the number you submit is within the result range (high or low); low range numbers are (1-49), high range numbers are (50-100) you are paid 1.98 to 1 instantly.</p>
		<p>If the number you submit is outside the result range you are not paid. Each roll takes at <em>least</em> 1 minute to complete. This is for security and to allow people to make late bets, so please, be patient.</p>
		<h2><a class="green" name="the_terms">Instructions</a></h2>
		<p><strong>IMPORTANT PLEASE READ BEFORE PLAYING:</strong></p>
		<p>During our pre-alpha release phase, each betting round will only accept a maximum of 4 players per round. This is only a temporary measure, to primarily keep gas costs down for our users as we continue to optimize Etheroll.</p>
		<p>If you are the 5th better of the round (submitting a late bet), for the moment you will be quietly refunded. We are working to make this current restriction a better experience by providing a 'current round full' notification. </p>
		<p>Each round takes up to 1 or 2 minutes, so be patient as each dice roll is in progress, do not close your browser window, you may lose your funds with no chance for recovery. You have been warned.</p>
		<p>Because Ethereum is still being heavily developed and the official Mist browser has not yet been publicly released, to play Etheroll currently you will need to:</p>
		<p class="green"><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
		<p>Run your own Ethereum blockchain and connect to Etheroll with the following command:</p>
		<p>geth --rpc --rpccorsdomain="http://etheroll.com" --unlock="your_wallet_address"</p>
		<p class="green"><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
		<p>You will be prompted to enter your password to unlock your account which will enable you to place bets and receive winnings from Etheroll. We never receive your password at anytime during your interaction with Etheroll.</p>
		<p class="green"><strong>Step 3</strong>:</p>
		<p>Once you have done this you can reload our website and you should see your wallet balance in the top right hand corner.</p>
		<p>During our pre-alpha release phase the maximum bet is 2 Ether. Do not send more than 2 Ether. No refunds.</p>
		<p>If you land at the site and it says "Bet in progress" wait until a new round starts before submitting any bets.</p>

		<h2><a class="green" name="the_result">How is the result decided?</a></h2>
		<p>((SeedA + SeedB + SeedC) / (2 ^ 256 / 100) ) +1 = result</p>
		<p>SeedA = Is set before you place your bet, and we cannot change it. Basically; when the first bet of the round is placed, the contract will retrieve and store the blockhash of the <em>parent block</em> relative to the block the first bet for the round was made on. The contract uses that as its SeedA number. See <a href="#provably_fair">'provably fair'</a> below for more details. 1st dice rolled. </p>
		<p>SeedB = Your number choice between 1-100, when you are the first better for that round. If a game is already in progress, and you are submitting late bets to the round, SeedB is generated by the first player to submit a bet in that round. 2nd dice rolled.</p>
		<p>SeedC = Hash of block in a future time. 3rd dice rolled.</p>
		<p>Before any bets are placed, we have already generated a number from a previous block hash. This is SeedA.</p>
		<p>Once a player submits a bet along with a number (SeedB) for a particular round, the Etheroll contract waits for a set number of new Ethereum blocks to be mined, so that we can the use a future block hash from which SeedC generated.</p>
		<p>Therefore SeedC is impossible for us, or you to know, prior to the submission of the bet as the block did not exist on the Blockchain at the time of your bet.</p>
		<p>Etheroll pays 1.98 to 1 if the number you submitted is within the resulting range, either 'high' or 'low'.</p>
		<p>The chance of the dice roll being either high or low is 50/50.</p>
		<h2><a class="green" name="provably_fair">Provably Fair</a></h2>
		<p>SeedA is generated by a block hash previous to your bet. By the time you make your bet, SeedA was already generated by the Ethereum Blockchain, we pull the block hash information from that block to use as SeedA.</p>
		<p>You can check the block number and compare its block hash to sha3 using any good block explorer. This will confirm that we did indeed use the number we said we did (a number that already existed before you made your bet). We provide the sha3 encrypted version of SeedA ('SHA3 of SeedA'). This is to prove that we do not (and could not - mathematical impossibility) change SeedA after you submit your bet. This means Etheroll will always have picked a number before you pick yours.</p>
		<h2><a class="green" name="roll_in_progress">Die roll is in progress</a></h2>
		<p>If you see this upon entering Etheroll it means somebody is already in the middle of a die roll. There is a limited time where you can add to the bet, but after you will not be able to place any bets until the die roll in progress is complete. Each roll takes ~6-8 blocks. The duration of each roll is dependant upon the speed of the network in general. REMEMBER: THIS ONLY RUNS ON THE TESTNET. NO REAL ETHER IS INVOLVED.</p>
